# SignalProcessing
 Notebook showing some functions I wrote for signal processing with nice visualization

## Datalookup - a multipurpose tool to explore, process signal, and visualize the processed signal.  
This allows you to load the signal (.mat) file, do filter (high/low pass), resample (up, down, downfft). 
You can look at the entire signal, or part of the signal.
I used this for segmentation task, and can also visualize the label (1 or 0) for a segment.

## Bandpass Filter 
Filter the signal using bandpass method and visualize the processed signal (before and after).
